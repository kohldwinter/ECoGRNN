# Brain-Controlled Mouse Interface

This project uses ECoG signal data to control mouse movement via an RNN supervised machine learning model. Achieved ~86% classification accuracy on custom input. Built in Python using PyTorch and NumPy.

## Features
- Data parsing of ECoG input
- Signal preprocessing
- ML pipeline with model selection
- Predictions of mouse position based on ECoG input

## Tech Stack
Python, numpy, pytorch, matplotlib
